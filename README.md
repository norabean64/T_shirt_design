# T-Shirt Design Application

## Project Goal

Develop a Python-based application for creating transparent T-shirt designs, utilizing an agentic architecture where specialized agents collaborate to generate and refine designs from user input.

## Agent Roles and Responsibilities

### Ideation Agent
- Brainstorms and suggests design ideas based on user input (keywords, themes, styles).
- Employs creative techniques (e.g., mood boards, visual references) to inspire new ideas.

### Prompt Engineer Agent
- Translates approved design concepts into effective prompts for the chosen image generation service.
- Tailors prompts to match the capabilities and style of the image generator.

### Product Manager Agent
- Acts as the central decision-maker, approving or rejecting designs, prompts, and generated images.
- Collaborates closely with the Legal Compliance Agent to ensure designs meet legal and ethical standards.
- Prioritizes user satisfaction and design quality in all decisions.

### Design Image Generator Agent
- Utilizes a chosen image generation service (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E) to generate design images based on prompts.
- Presents generated images to the Product Manager Agent for approval.

### Descriptions Agent
- Generates descriptive keywords, tags, and hashtags for finalized designs.
- Crafts compelling titles and short descriptions for marketing and SEO purposes.

### Legal Compliance Agent
- Ensures that all design elements and generated content comply with copyright, trademark, and other relevant legal regulations.
- Advises the Product Manager Agent on potential legal risks and mitigation strategies.

### UserProfile Agent
- Manages user profiles, preferences, and history.
- Personalizes design suggestions based on user data.

### Notification Agent
- Handles notifications to users about the status of their designs, feedback, and other updates.

### Collaboration Agent
- Facilitates collaboration between multiple users or designers on a single project.
- Manages contributions and interactions within collaborative projects.

### CEO Agent
- Manages the interactions between other agents.
- Coordinates the workflow, handles dependencies, and ensures each step is executed in the correct order.

### ErrorHandling Agent
- Handles errors and exceptions.
- Logs errors for better traceability.

### Cache Agent
- Improves performance by caching data.
- Manages cache storage and retrieval.

### Security Agent
- Handles security-related tasks like authentication and data encryption.
- Manages user credentials and ensures secure data handling.

## Additional Considerations

- **User Interface**: Design an intuitive interface for user input, agent interaction, and design preview/approval.
- **Image Generation Service**: Choose a suitable image generation service that aligns with the application's design style and target audience.
- **Universal Tags**: Explore implementing a flexible tagging system that allows users to categorize designs and search for specific styles or themes.
- **Testing**: Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure agent collaboration and overall functionality.
- **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect user data, design intellectual property, and prevent unauthorized access.

## Codebase Development and Testing

The complete codebase is structured into modules corresponding to each agent, with well-defined APIs for communication and collaboration. Unit tests validate individual agent behaviors, while integration tests verify seamless interaction between agents.
